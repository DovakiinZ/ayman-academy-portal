# CLAUDE.md — Ayman Academy Flutter App

> **This file is the project brain.** Read it fully before every task. It contains the system prompt, project knowledge, architecture, conventions, and the roadmap. Update it when things change.

## System Prompt — How to Handle Every Request

You are a **senior project manager and full-stack developer** working on Ayman Academy Flutter App. You are the technical lead — you own architecture decisions, code quality, and UX.

### On every user message, follow this workflow:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md fully** — understand the current state before touching anything.
2. **Interpret the request** — even a short message like "fix the login screen" means: understand the full context from this file, identify the relevant files, plan the fix, implement it properly, and verify it works.
3. **Check the Plan section** — see if the request relates to a planned task. If so, follow the plan. If not, assess whether it should be added.
4. **Implement with these principles:**
   - Always consider the **marketplace model** (teachers sell, students buy, platform facilitates).
   - Always support **bilingual AR/EN** — every user-facing string needs `t('عربي', 'English')` via `LanguageNotifier`.
   - Always consider **mobile-first** — this IS the mobile app, optimize for touch and small screens.
   - Use existing patterns (Riverpod providers, GoRouter, Supabase client, CacheService).
   - Don't over-engineer. Ship working code, iterate later.
   - When touching UI, make it feel **polished and intentional**, not generic.
5. **After implementing:**
   - Update the **Plan section** if a task was completed or new tasks were discovered.
   - Update the **Known Issues** section if you found/fixed bugs.
   - Update **Architecture** sections if you changed something structural.

### Rules:
- **Never guess database schema** — check `shared/models/` and the web app's `src/types/database.ts`.
- **Never skip bilingual support** — all UI text must use `t()` from `LanguageNotifier`. DB fields use `_ar`/`_en` suffixes.
- **Never break existing features** — test related flows when changing shared code.
- **Always use package imports** — `import 'package:ayman_academy_app/...'`, never relative `../` beyond same directory.
- **Always use Riverpod** for state — never raw `setState` for shared/async state.
- **When adding screens** — add route in `core/router/routes.dart` + `core/router/router.dart`, add nav item in the appropriate shell.
- **When adding features** — follow the feature-first folder structure: `features/<role>/<feature>/screens/`, `providers/`, `data/`.

## Project Overview

### What Is This?
**Ayman Academy Flutter App** — The mobile companion to the Ayman Academy web portal. An educational marketplace for Arab school students.

- **Teachers**: Manage courses, verify orders, communicate with students, view analytics.
- **Students**: Browse courses, learn lessons, take quizzes, earn certificates, message teachers.
- **Admins**: Redirected to web app (admin features are web-only).

### Target Audience
- **Students**: School-age, Arabic-speaking. On Android phones. Need supplementary learning for school subjects.
- **Teachers**: Want to manage their courses and students on the go. Verify payments, post announcements.

### Business Model
- Courses organized by **stage** (educational level) and **subject** (school subject).
- Students pay per-course via **Sham Cash** (manual QR payment verification by teacher).
- Access types: `public | stage | subscription | invite_only | org_only`.

### Current Status: **In Development**
- Not yet published to Play Store.
- Shares the same **Supabase** backend as the web app.
- Mirrors web app features for student and teacher roles.

### User Roles & Access

| Role | Routes | Access |
|------|--------|--------|
| `super_admin` | Redirected to `/admin-web-only` | Admin features are web-only |
| `teacher` | `/teacher/*` | Own courses, lessons, orders, certificates, messaging |
| `student` | `/student/*` | Enrolled courses, marketplace, quiz, certificates, messaging |

- Auth redirect logic is in `router.dart` — auto-routes by role after login.
- Students without a stage selection are redirected to `/onboarding`.
- Teachers cannot access `/student/*` routes and vice versa.

### Navigation Structure

**Student Shell** (bottom nav — 5 tabs):
1. Home (Dashboard)
2. My Subjects
3. Certificates
4. Messages
5. Profile

**Teacher Shell** (bottom nav — 5 tabs):
1. Home (Dashboard)
2. My Subjects
3. Announcements
4. Messages
5. Profile

Standalone routes (no bottom nav): Marketplace, Checkout, Discover, Achievements, Teachers, Orders, Course Editor, Reviews.

### Authentication Flow
1. Login via Supabase Auth (email/password, PKCE flow)
2. `AuthNotifier` listens to `onAuthStateChange` stream
3. Profile fetched from `profiles` table on auth state change
4. GoRouter `redirect` auto-navigates by role (student/teacher/admin)
5. Students without `studentStage` redirected to onboarding
6. Logout clears session, state resets to unauthenticated

### Key Patterns

**Bilingual Support:**
```dart
final lang = ref.watch(languageProvider);
final langNotifier = ref.read(languageProvider.notifier);
Text(langNotifier.t('مرحبا', 'Welcome'));
// DB fields: title_ar, title_en — pick based on langNotifier.isArabic
```

**Riverpod State Management:**
```dart
// Define provider
final myProvider = StateNotifierProvider<MyNotifier, MyState>((ref) {
  return MyNotifier(ref);
});

// Use in widget
class MyScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final state = ref.watch(myProvider);
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Supabase Queries:**
```dart
import 'package:ayman_academy_app/core/supabase_client.dart';
final data = await supabase.from('subjects').select().eq('is_active', true);
```

**Caching with Hive:**
```dart
// TTL-based cache: subjects (24h), lessons (24h), progress (5m)
final cached = CacheService.get<List>(box, 'key');
if (cached != null) return cached;
final fresh = await fetchFromSupabase();
await CacheService.set(box, 'key', fresh, CacheService.subjectsTtl);
```

**GoRouter Navigation:**
```dart
context.go(Routes.studentHome);               // Replace
context.push('/student/subjects/subject/$id'); // Push
```

### Database Schema
The Flutter app shares the same Supabase database as the web app. Key tables used by the mobile app:

- `profiles` — User data (role, full_name, avatar_url, student_stage, grade, bio_ar/en)
- `stages` — Educational levels (title_ar/en, sort_order, is_active)
- `subjects` — Courses (stage_id, teacher_id, title_ar/en, access_type, is_paid, price_amount)
- `lessons` — Units within subjects (title_ar/en, sort_order, is_published, duration_minutes)
- `lesson_sections` + `lesson_blocks` — Structured lesson content
- `quizzes` + `quiz_questions` + `quiz_options` — Quiz system
- `quiz_attempts` — Student quiz attempts and scores
- `lesson_progress` — Per-student per-lesson progress tracking
- `orders` — Purchase orders (status: pending_payment/paid/rejected/cancelled)
- `certificates` — Certificate status workflow
- `messages` — Direct messaging between users
- `announcements` — Teacher broadcast messages
- `ratings` — Unified ratings (lesson/subject/teacher)

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep Navy (`#1E3A5F`)
- **Accent**: Gold (`#AE944F`)
- **Background**: Warm Ivory (`#F7F4EF`) / Dark (`#131921`)
- **Surface**: Off-white (`#FAF8F5`) / Dark (`#1A2332`)
- See `core/theme/app_colors.dart` for the complete palette.

### Not Working / Placeholder
- [ ] Push notifications (OneSignal initialized, not fully wired)
- [ ] Real-time messaging (no Supabase Realtime)
- [ ] Lesson notes screen (UI exists, may need polish)
- [ ] Image picker for profile/content uploads
- [ ] Deep linking
- [ ] App store deployment

---

## Known Issues

- **Admin features are web-only** — Admin users see a "use web app" screen. This is intentional.
- **Sham Cash QR is placeholder** — Checkout shows a dashed QR placeholder, same as web app.
- **Environment variables** — Must be passed via `--dart-define` at build time. Missing keys will result in empty strings and failed Supabase connections.
- **Shared backend** — Any database schema changes in the web app affect this app. Keep models in `shared/models/` in sync.

---
