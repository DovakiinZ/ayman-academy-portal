# CLAUDE.md — Ayman Academy Portal

> **This file is the project brain.** Read it fully before every task. It contains the system prompt, project knowledge, architecture, conventions, and the roadmap. Update it when things change.

## System Prompt — How to Handle Every Request

You are a **senior project manager and full-stack developer** working on Ayman Academy Portal. You are the technical lead — you own architecture decisions, code quality, and UX.

### On every user message, follow this workflow:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md fully** — understand the current state before touching anything.
2. **Interpret the request** — even a short message like "fix the subscription page" means: understand the full context from this file, identify the relevant files, plan the fix, implement it properly, and verify it works.
3. **Check the Plan section** — see if the request relates to a planned task. If so, follow the plan. If not, assess whether it should be added.
4. **Implement with these principles:**
   - Always consider the **marketplace model** (teachers sell, students buy, platform facilitates).
   - Always support **bilingual AR/EN** — every user-facing string needs `t('عربي', 'English')`.
   - Always consider **mobile-first** — most students will be on phones.
   - Use existing patterns (adminDb, useLanguage, React Hook Form + Zod, TanStack Query).
   - Don't over-engineer. Ship working code, iterate later.
   - When touching UI, make it feel **polished and intentional**, not generic.
5. **After implementing:**
   - Update the **Plan section** if a task was completed or new tasks were discovered.
   - Update the **Known Issues** section if you found/fixed bugs.
   - Update **Architecture** sections if you changed something structural.

### Rules:
- **Never guess database schema** — check `src/types/database.ts` and Supabase.
- **Never skip bilingual support** — all UI text must use `t()` or have `_ar`/`_en` fields.
- **Never break existing features** — test related flows when changing shared code.
- **Always use `@/` imports** — never relative paths beyond `./` within same directory.
- **Always use adminDb** for mutations — never raw `supabase.from().update()` in page components.
- **When creating forms** — use React Hook Form + Zod, with AR/EN tabs pattern.
- **When adding pages** — add route in App.tsx, add nav item in `src/config/nav.ts`.

## Project Overview

### What Is This?
**Ayman Academy Portal** — An educational marketplace platform (like Udemy but for Arab school students).

- **Teachers** sign up → create courses for school subjects → sell them to students.
- **Students** sign up → browse courses by their grade/stage → subscribe and learn.
- **Platform** provides the audience, tools, and infrastructure.

### Target Audience
- **Teachers**: Want to monetize teaching. Need easy course creation tools (lesson editor, quiz builder, etc.).
- **Students**: School-age, Arabic-speaking. Need supplementary learning for school subjects they struggle with. Subscribe to individual courses or plans.

### Business Model
- Courses organized by **stage** (educational level) → **subject** (school subject).
- Students select their stage/grade during onboarding.
- Access types: `public | stage | subscription | invite_only | org_only`.
- Payment/subscription system is **planned but not built yet**.

### Current Status: **In Development**
- Not yet live / not in production.
- Deployed on **Vercel** (vercel.json configured).
- Backend: **Supabase** (auth + PostgreSQL + storage + Edge Functions).
- AI services: Supabase Edge Function (`ai-assist`) calls Groq API with `openai/gpt-oss-20b`. Needs `GROQ_API_KEY` set in Supabase secrets.

### User Roles & Access

| Role | Routes | Access |
|------|--------|--------|
| `super_admin` | `/admin/*` + `/teacher/*` | Everything |
| `teacher` | `/teacher/*` | Own courses, lessons, quizzes |
| `student` | `/student/*` | Enrolled courses + discovery |

- `AdminRoute` = super_admin only
- `TeacherRoute` = teacher OR super_admin
- `StudentRoute` = student only (with onboarding check — redirects to `/student/onboarding` if no stage selected)

### Context Providers (wrapped in App.tsx)
1. `PersistQueryClientProvider` — Cache persistence
2. `BrowserRouter` — Routing
3. `AuthProvider` — Auth + profile (5s timeout, 1 retry)
4. `SettingsProvider` — Feature toggles
5. `LanguageProvider` — AR/EN with RTL/LTR
6. `TemplateProvider` — Dynamic text templates
7. `TooltipProvider` + `Toaster` + `Sonner` — UI utilities

### Authentication Flow
1. Login via Supabase Auth → session stored in localStorage (`ayman-academy-auth`)
2. Profile fetched with 5s timeout + 1 retry
3. Auto-redirect by role after login
4. Protected routes via `<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['role']}>`
5. Logout clears cache + query state

### Key Patterns

**Bilingual Support:**
```tsx
const { t, language, direction } = useLanguage();
<h1>{t('مرحبا', 'Welcome')}</h1>
// DB fields: title_ar, title_en
```

**Database Operations (adminDb.ts):**
```tsx
import { verifiedInsert, verifiedUpdate, verifiedDelete } from '@/lib/adminDb';
await verifiedUpdate('subjects', id, { title_ar: 'new' });
// Auto-verifies, auto-toasts, auto-auth-checks
```

**Forms:**
```tsx
const form = useForm<FormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  defaultValues: {...}
});
// Pattern: AR/EN tabs, active toggle, sort_order, toast feedback
```

**React Query:**
- Stale times: STATIC (24h), SEMI_STATIC (1h), DYNAMIC (5m), CONTENT (30m)
- No refetch on window focus/reconnect (intentional)
- localStorage persistence with 24h max age
- Query keys in `src/lib/queryKeys.ts`

### Database Schema — Key Tables

**Core Content:**
- `profiles` — Users (id, email, full_name, role, avatar_url, student_stage, grade, gender, bio_ar/en)
- `stages` — Educational levels (title_ar/en, sort_order, is_active, show_on_home)
- `subjects` — Courses (stage_id, teacher_id, title_ar/en, access_type, is_paid, price_amount)
- `lessons` — Units within subjects (title_ar/en, sort_order, is_published, duration_minutes)

**Lesson Content (section/block model):**
- `lesson_sections` — Groups of blocks within a lesson
- `lesson_blocks` — Content blocks (type: rich_text|video|image|file|link|tip|warning|example|exercise|qa|equation)
- Each block: type, title_ar/en, content_ar/en, url, metadata JSONB, sort_order

**Quiz System:**
- `quizzes` — Linked to lesson OR subject (passing_score, attempts_allowed)
- `quiz_questions` — Types: mcq, true_false, multi_select (question_ar/en, explanation_ar/en)
- `quiz_options` — Answer choices (text_ar/en, is_correct)
- `quiz_attempts` — Student attempts (score_percent, answers, timestamps)

**Progress & Learning:**
- `lesson_progress` — Per-student per-lesson (progress_percent, last_position_seconds, completed_at)
- `lesson_notes` — Timestamped student notes
- `lesson_comments` — Discussion on lessons
- `ratings` — Unified ratings (entity_type: lesson|subject|teacher, stars 1-5)

**Certificates:**
- `certificates` — Status workflow: draft → eligible → pending_approval → issued → revoked
- `certificate_rules` — Eligibility criteria per subject (rule_json tree with AND/OR/progress/exam conditions)
- `templates` — Dynamic text with {{token}} interpolation

**Access & Commerce:**
- `plans` — Subscription tiers (billing: monthly|yearly|lifetime, price_cents)
- `subscriptions` — Student subs (status: trialing|active|past_due|expired|cancelled)
- `student_subjects` — Explicit enrollment
- `subject_invites` — Invite-only access
- `organizations` + `org_members` + `org_subjects` — Org-based access
- `coupons` + `coupon_redemptions` — Discount codes

**Communication:**
- `messages` — Direct messages (sender_id, receiver_id, content, read_at)
- `announcements` — Teacher broadcasts (bilingual)
- `audit_logs` — Activity tracking

**RPC Functions (Postgres):**
- `get_student_subjects()` — Returns enrolled subjects with entitlement_reason + progress
- `get_discover_subjects()` — Returns discoverable subjects with lock_reason
- `check_subject_access()` / `check_lesson_access()` — Access verification
- `request_certificate()` — Student initiates certificate request
- `admin_approve_certificate()` / `admin_reissue_certificate()` / `admin_revoke_certificate()`

### Not Working / Placeholder
- [ ] AI content assistance (Edge Function ready, needs GROQ_API_KEY in Supabase secrets)
- [ ] Translation service (Edge Function ready, needs GROQ_API_KEY in Supabase secrets)
- [ ] Payment processing (DB schema exists, no UI or integration)
- [ ] Real-time messaging (no Supabase Realtime)
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (recharts installed, no visualizations)
- [ ] Parent dashboard (route exists, minimal UI)

---

## Known Issues

- **Sham Cash QR code is placeholder** — The checkout page shows a dashed QR placeholder. Need to add real QR code image upload via admin settings or teacher profile.
- **Payment model is per-teacher** — Money goes directly to teachers via Sham Cash. Currently using a single platform-level QR. Per-teacher QR codes should be added to teacher profiles.
- **lesson_content vs lesson_blocks**: Old `lesson_content` table referenced in earlier docs, but code uses `lesson_sections` + `lesson_blocks`. Need to verify which is active in Supabase.

---

## Plan — Roadmap & Tasks

> Update this section as tasks are completed or new ones are discovered. Mark completed items with [x].

### Phase 1: Marketplace & Payment Workflow (Current Priority)
- [x] **Marketplace page** (`/student/marketplace`) — Students browse subjects filtered by stage, see teacher + price + lesson count, add to cart.
- [x] **Checkout page** (`/student/checkout`) — 3-step flow: order summary → Sham Cash payment (QR + student name/account input) → confirmation.
- [x] **Teacher orders page** (`/teacher/orders`) — Teachers see pending orders, verify Sham Cash payment, confirm (grants access) or reject.
- [x] **Order type + DB schema** — `orders` table with status workflow: pending_payment → paid/rejected/cancelled.
- [x] **Navigation updates** — Marketplace in student nav, Orders in teacher nav.
- [x] **Dashboard CTA** — New students directed to marketplace instead of old browse page.
- [ ] **Sham Cash QR code configuration** — Admin needs UI to upload/configure the Sham Cash QR code (currently placeholder).
- [ ] **Teacher profile payment info** — Teachers should set their Sham Cash account in profile (for per-teacher payments later).
- [x] **Teacher application flow** — Public form at `/apply/teacher`, admin review at `/admin/applications`, approve → creates invite link.
- [x] **Landing page "Teach with Us" section** — CTA section on homepage linking to teacher application.
- [ ] **Create `teacher_applications` table in Supabase** — Run the SQL migration (see Known Issues).
- [ ] **Registration flow polish** — Make role selection, onboarding, and first-time experience feel smooth and intentional.
- [ ] **General UI/UX polish** — Fix vague screens, improve navigation clarity, ensure consistent design language.
- [ ] **Create `orders` table in Supabase** — Run the SQL migration (see below in Known Issues).

### Phase 2: Marketplace Enhancements
- [x] **Course preview page** (`/student/course/:subjectId`) — Udemy-style detail page: hero with title/description/stats, curriculum with free preview lessons, teacher bio, sticky enroll CTA.
- [x] **Marketplace → course preview** — Cards in marketplace are now clickable, linking to the course detail page.
- [ ] **Per-subject ratings display** — Show average rating on marketplace cards.
- [ ] **Coupon system UI** — Apply discount codes during checkout.
- [ ] **Order notifications** — Notify student when teacher confirms/rejects payment.
